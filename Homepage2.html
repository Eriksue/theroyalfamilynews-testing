        <p>
            Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years.<br>

            She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer.<br>

            The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change.

        <p>
            Succession to the British throne is determined by descent, gender,<br>
            legitimacy, and religion. Under common law, the Crown is inherited by<br>
            a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral<br>
            line.
