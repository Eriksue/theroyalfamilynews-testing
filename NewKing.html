        <p>
            At the moment the Queen died, the throne passed immediately and without ceremony to the heir, Charles, the former Prince of Wales.<br>

            But there are a number of practical - and traditional - steps which he must go through to be crowned King.<br>
            
            He will be known as King Charles III.<br>

            That was the first decision of the new king's reign. He could have chosen from any of his four names - Charles Philip Arthur George.<br>

            He is not the only one who faces a change of title. Prince William and his wife Catherine are now titled Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge, and the king has conferred on them the title of Prince and Princess of Wales.<br>

            There is also a new title for Charles' wife, Camilla, who becomes the Queen Consort - consort is the term used for the spouse of the monarch.
