        <h1>The line of Succession | British Royal Family</h1>
        <p>
            Succession to the British throne is determined by descent, gender,<br>
            legitimacy, and religion. Under common law, the Crown is inherited by<br>
            a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral<br>
            line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 restrict<br>
            succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of<br>
            Sophia of Hanover who are in "communion with the Church of England".<br>
            Spouses of Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was<br>
            amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being<br>
            Roman Catholics are eligible.
